1. Paste the unzipped folder under your ImageJFiji's subfolder "scripts/" then restart ImageJFiji to find the plugin now sitting in the header menu.   
2. Install the toolbox by clicking the "Install" option in the dropdown list. Let the self-installation coding run by itself.  
3. Restart ImageJFiji, go to "9. Developer's Box/Change Default Settings" to change/confirm your default image setting preference following the instructions.  
4. Now you may enjoy the toolbox' eight major functions that can help you measure image resolutions, multi-sublayer thickness, cell numbers, and free distances on OCT/histology/immunostaining cross-section slides of retinae, as well as performing batch OCT image processing on selected folders.  
5. Please also keep in mind that this plugin is coupled with a powerful memory bank that will record your image parameters/processing choices to help you analyse you images even faster, and is powered by automatic parameter-pulling from your image names if your file names contain sample strain name/left-or-right-eye information.  
6. Feel free to re-code the software to better accommodate your research/clinical needs by directly accessing the core function codings under "9. Developer's Box".
