This is a self-developed open-source imageJFIJI multi-function toolbox for academic use that can measure image resolutions, multi-sublayer thickness (up to 20 sublayers), cell numbers, and free distances on OCT/histology/immunostaining cross-section slides of retinae as well as performing batch image processing on selected folders, both fully automatically or machine-assisted.

1. Paste the unzipped folder under your ImageJFiji's subfolder "scripts/" then restart ImageJFiji to find the plugin now sitting in the header menu.   
2. Install the toolbox by clicking the "Install" option in the dropdown list. Let the self-installation coding run by itself.  
3. Restart ImageJFiji, go to "9. Developer's Box/Change Default Settings" to change/confirm your default image setting preference following the instructions to fully initialise the toolbox.  
4. Now you may enjoy the toolbox' eight major functions in the dropdown menu.  
5. Please also keep in mind that this toolbox is coupled with a powerful memory bank that will record your image parameters/processing choices to help you analyse you images even faster, and is powered by automatic parameter-pulling from your image names if your file names contain sample strain names/left-or-right-eye information. You may also teach the toolbox to recognise your strain names by following pop-up instructions.  
6. Feel free to re-code the software to better accommodate your research/clinical needs by directly accessing the core function codings under "9. Developer's Box".
